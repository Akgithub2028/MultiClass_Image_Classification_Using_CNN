# MultiClass Image Classification using CNN and Transfer Learning :
This is a multi-class classification model of Alzheimer Disease's  risk level into 4 categories, using Convolution Neural Networks Architecture and Transfer Learning on a dataset of 44,000 MRI images of the human brain.

# About the Dataset :
The Alzheimer's Disease Multiclass Dataset contains approximately 44,000 MRI images categorized into four distinct classes based on the severity of Alzheimer's disease. This dataset is intended for use in machine learning model training and testing. All images are skull-stripped and clean of non-brain tissue.

## Dataset Structure
The dataset is organized into the following four directories, each representing a different class of disease severity :
**NonDemented** : Contains 12,800 MRI images of subjects with no signs of dementia.
**VeryMildDemented** : Contains 11,200 MRI images of subjects with very mild symptoms of dementia.
**MildDemented** : Contains 10,000 MRI images of subjects with mild dementia.
**ModerateDemented** : Contains 10,000 MRI images of subjects with moderate dementia.

## Image Details :
**Total Number of Images** : 44,000
**Image Format** : MRI scans as .JPG files
**Image Usage** : Suitable for training and testing machine learning models focused on classifying Alzheimer's disease stages.

# Disease Severity Classification :
The dataset follows a severity ranking system for Alzheimer's disease:
**NonDemented** : No dementia.
**Very Mild Demented** : Early signs of dementia, very mild symptoms.
**Mild Demented** : Clear signs of dementia, but still mild.
**Moderate Demented** : More pronounced symptoms of dementia, moderate severity.
